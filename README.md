# Diabetes_prediction
this project is built using various classification machine learning models to predict the onset of diabetes within five years in women with Pima Indian heritage who were given medical details about their bodies.
Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. Most of the food you eat is broken down into sugar (also called glucose) and released into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin.
Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your bodyâ€™s cells for use as energy.
